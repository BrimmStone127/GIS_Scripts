OVERVIEW

This program takes a .txt document of filenames and will then search through a folder for these items using a binary search algorithm. 


SETUP

To run this script right click on the python file and select EDIT WITH IDLE or use your preferred python IDE (Interactive Development Environment). Once the IDE loads edit 
the Path variable to reflect the pathway needed to access the setup files. Change the open command to have the path of the .txt with your needed files. 
Once the variable is edited you should be able to run the module/file from the IDE.
